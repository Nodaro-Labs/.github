# Nodaro

**Nodaro is a student-led organization empowering the next generation of hardware builders.**

We believe great ideas shouldn’t be held back by high costs, limited access, or a lack of resources. Today, learning to code is more accessible than ever—but building real, physical technology often isn’t. Nodaro exists to change that.

Our mission is to make hardware creation as accessible and achievable as software development, giving students the opportunity to explore, prototype, and bring their ideas into the real world.

## Who We Are

Nodaro is a Canadian student organization dedicated to lowering the barrier to entry for hardware innovation. Through hands-on projects, workshops, publications, and an upcoming incubator program, we provide students with the tools, knowledge, and community needed to build real hardware technologies.

Having built our own hardware projects, we experienced firsthand how difficult it can be to get started—due to high costs, limited regional availability, and inaccessible resources. Nodaro was created to remove these obstacles and ensure that promising ideas never die because of accessibility challenges.

We are committed to helping the next generation of innovators turn ideas from **theory into fruition**.

## What We Do

- Run hands-on workshops focused on practical hardware skills  
- Support student-led hardware projects from concept to prototype  
- Publish student work through a hardware-focused journal  
- Launch an incubator program to help projects scale beyond prototypes  
- Foster a build-in-public, open, and collaborative engineering culture
